# Hello, I'm Ricardo ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a passionate full-stack software engineer eager to make my mark in the tech world! With expertise in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PostgreSQL, and React, I thrive on taking on complex challenges and learning new things.

While I'm not at my computer, I love to cook interesting and new dishes and go hiking.

Recently, I built [Splinter](https://splinter-app.github.io/), an open-source ETL pipeline for transforming unstructured data into vectors for AI/ML workflows.

Read more about Splinter [here](https://splinter-app.github.io/)!
